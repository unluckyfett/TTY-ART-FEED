                           IT TWAS THE
                           NIGHT BEFORE
                         CHRISTMAS, WHEN
                        ALL THROUGH THE
                        HOUSE......NOT A
                      CREATURE WAS STIRRING,
                      NOT EVEN A MOUSE.....
                      WHEN DOWN THROUGH THE
                     CHIMMEY, ALL COVERED WITH
                     SOOT...CAME THE "SPIRIT OF
                     FIRE," AN UGLY GALOOT....
                    HIS EYES GLOWED LIKE EMBERS,
                    HIS FEATURES WERE STERN...AS
                    HE LOOKED ALL AROUND HIM FOR
                   SOMETHING TO BURN.....WHAT HE
                   SAW MADE HIM GRUMBLE-HIS ANGER
                  GREW HIGHER...FOR THERE WASN'T A
                 THING THAT WOULD START A GOOD FIRE...
                  NO DOOR HAD BEEN BLOCKED BY THE BIG
                CHRISTMAS TREE...IT STOOD IN THE CORNER,
                 LEAVING PASAGEWAY FREE.....THE LIGHTS
                THAT GLOW BRIGHTLY FOR BETTY AND TIM....
               HAD BEEN HUNG WITH PRECAUTION  . SO NONE
              TOUCHED A LIMB.....ALL WIRING - NEW, NOT
              A BREAK COULD BE SEEN...AND WET SAND AT ITS
             BASE KEPT THE TREE NICE AND GREEN...THE TREE
              HAD BEEN TRIMMED BY A MOTHER INSISTENT.....
            THAT THE ORNAMENTS  SHOULD BE FIRE RESUSTANT
             ...THE MOTHERS HAD KNOWN THE TRIMING TO AVOID
            ...LIKE COTTEN AND PAPER AND CELLULOID,...ROCK
            WOOL, METAL ICICLES AND TRINKETS OF GLASS...GAVE
            LIFE TO THE TREE---IT REALLY HAD CLASS.....AND
           WOULD YOU BELEIVE IT, RIGHT NEXT TO THE TREE...
              WAS A SUITABLE BOX FOR HOLDING DEBRIS-...
             A PLACE TO HOLD WRAPPING PAPER AND STRING,
          ...FROM ALL OF THE GIFTS THAT SANTA MIGHT BRING...
              THE UGLY GALOOT WAS SO MAD HE COULD BUST...
            AS HE CLIMBED UP THE CHIMMEY IN UTTER DISGUST!
             ...FOR THE FOLKS IN THIS HOME HAD PAID CLOSE
                         ATTENTION...TO ALL
                            OF THE RULES
                            OF GOOD FIRE
                             PREVENTION.
