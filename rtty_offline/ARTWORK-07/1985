            LIQUOR AND LONGEVITY


THE HORSE AND MULE LIVE 30 YEARS

AND NOTHING KNOW OF WINE AND BEERS.

THE GOAT AND SHEEP AT 20 DIE

AND NEVER TASTE OF SCOTCH OR RYE.

THE COW DRINKS WATER BY THE TON

AND AT 18 IS ALMOST DONE.

THE DOG AT 15 CASHES IN

WITHOUT THE AID OF RUM OR GIN.

THE CAT IN MILK AND WATER SOAKS

AND THEN IN 12 SHORT YEARS IT CROAKS.

THE MODEST, SOBER, BONE-DRY HEN

LAYS EGGS FOR NOGS,  THEN DIES AT 10.

ALL ANIMALS ARE STRICTLY DRY,

THEY SINLESS LIVE AND SWIFTLY DIE.

BUT SINFUL, GINFUL, RUM-SOAKED MEN

SURVIVE FOR THREESCORE YEARS AND TEN.

AND SOME OF US, THE MIGHTY FEW,

KEEP DRINKIN' TILL WE'RE 92
