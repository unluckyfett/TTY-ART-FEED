HI SON:

  GUESS I SHOULD WRITE YOU THE LATEST NEWS CUZ OUR SKEDS SURE HAVE
BEEN ROTTEN.  MY OLD PRINTER JUST WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE OUT OF YOUR
COPY.  I COULD TELL YOU DID SOME WORK ON YOUR VFO CUZ YOU WERE ONLY
DRIFTING ABOUT 8 KCS  BUT IT'S STILL KIND OF WOBBLEY.  SORT OF SOUNDS
LIKE THAT SULPHUR SPRING BUBBLING OUT OF THE ROCKS DOWN ON OUR NORTH
FOURTY.  BIGGEST TROUBLE WAS YOUR SHIFT.  IT MOVED AROUND BETWEEN
ABOUT 980 CYCLES AND 1050 CYCLES AND WAS UPSIDE DOWN!  MY OLE TU GOT
REAL DIZZY TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH IT.  OUTSIDE OF THAT, YOUR SIGNAL
WAS REAL CLEAN AND MUCH BETTER THAN OUR LAST SKED WHEN THAT CW SMART
ALECK BROKE IN AND ASKED IF YOU WAS A RUSSIAN JAMMING STATION.

    I HEARD YOU ON PHONE LAST WEDNESDAY BUT DIDN'T CALL YOU BECAUSE I
HAD A LITTLE ACCIDENT AND CAN'T SPEAK VERY PLAIN UNTIL I GET A NEW SET
OF STORE TEETH.  IT HAPPENED LIKE THIS:  I WAS MAKING A FEW ADJUSTMENTS
ON MY MODEL 36 HAD MY FACE UP CLOSE TO THE RIGHT HAND END OF THE
PRINTER, PEERING INTO THAT MESS OF LEVERS AND SPRINGS WHEN I MUST HAVE
ACCIDENTLY TRIPPED THE CARRIAGE RELEASE LEVER.  THE DOC SAYS MY NEW
CHOPPERS WILL BE READY NEXT WEEK.  IT WAS ROUGH, SON,  BEEN LIVING ON
SOUP AND JELLO EVER SINCE.  BY THE WAY, MY DENTIST IS ALSO A RTTY HAM
AND HE IS TRYING TO PUT SOME OF HIS TELETYPE SAVVY INTO HIS DENTAL WORK
FOR INSTANCE, HE GOT AN IDEA FROM THE "UNSHIFT ON SPACE" DEAL SO THAT
HE SAYS THAT MY NEW CHINA CLIPPERS WILL HAVE AN ARRANGEMENT WHERE I CAN
UNSHIFT ON TAFFY OR CARAMELS.  NOT BAD EH, KID?
