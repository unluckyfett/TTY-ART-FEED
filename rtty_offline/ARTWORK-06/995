                       "SERVICE WITH A SMILE"

THE FOLLOWING LETTER HAS BEEN RECEIVED FROM MISS PAREE, MANAGER OF THE
SEYMOUR NUDIST CAMP FOR GIRLS.

GENTLEMEN,
     I WISH TO EXPRESS MY SINCERE THANKS TO YOU FOR THE EXCELLENT
SERVICE YOUR LINEMEN PERFORMED LAST SUMMER.  IT WAS EXPLAINED TO US
THAT THE TRANSFORMER ON THE POLE NEXT TO OUR SWIMMING POOL WAS OF A
SPECIAL TYPE THAT HAD TO BE DUSTED TWICE A DAY, OILED ONCE A WEEK, AND
HAVE THE BOLTS TIGHTENED EVERY TEN DAYS.
     A MR. WATT EXPLAINED TO ME THAT UNLESS THE TRANSFORMER WAS
DUSTED REGULARLY, THE DUST WOULD COAGULATE WITH THE PAINT WHICH WOULD
SET UP A CHEMICAL IMBALANCE OF THE HYDROFOIL AND CAUSE A GREAT DEAL
OF TROUBLE.  I AM HAPPY TO REPORT THAT YOUR LINE CREW FAITHFULLY
STOPPED EVERY MORNING AND AFTERNOON AND SPENT 15 MINUTES DUSTING THE
TRANSFORMER.
     WHILE THIS OPERATION WAS BEING CARRIED ON, A MR. VOLT STOOD ON
TOP OF THE TRUCK CAB OVERLOOKING THE EIGHT FOOT FENCE AROUND OUR CAMP
AND CAREFULLY WARNED THE GIRLS AROUND THE POOL NOT TO GET TO CLOSE TO
THE TRANSFORMER.
     YOUR CREWS ALWAYS WERE VERY CONSCIENTIOUS IN MAKING REPAIRS. ON
ONE OCCASION, A CROSSARM BROKE ON THE POLE NEXT TO THE TENNIS COURT
WHERE SOME OF THE GIRLS WERE PLAYING TENNIS.  NINE MEN WITH THREE LAD-
DER TRUCKS WORKED FOUR HOURS TO REPLACE THE ARM. THEY HANGED A CROSS-
ARM' PUT A LEVEL ON IT' THEN UNBOLTED IT AND INSTALLED ANOTHER. A MR.
SHOCK EXPLAINED TO ME THAT UNLESS THE CROSSARM WAS ABSOLUTELY LEVEL'
THE WIRE TO THE TRANSFORMER BY THE SWIMMING POOL WOULD SAG' THE POWER
FLOW WOULD GET UNEVEN' AS A RESULT ONLY HALF THE SWIMMING POOL WOULD BE
HEATED WHILE THE OTHER HALF REMAINED COLD.
     EVIDENTLY WE HAVE A SPECIAL TYPE OF METER BY THE SWIMMING POOL.
THE METER READER TOLD US IT HAD TO BE READ ONCE A WEEK BY TWO MEN SO
THAT AN EXACT AVERAGE OF POWER COULD BE CALCULATED.  ONE OF YOUR METER
READERS IS RATHER CLUMSY, BECAUSE DURING LAST SUMMER HE FELL OVER TWO
LAWN CHAIRS, A PICNIC TABLE, AND A GARBAGE CAN WHILE WALCING OVER TO
CHECK THE METER.
     I WISH TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE WONDERFUL ATTENTION YOUR LINE
CREWS AND METER READERS GAVE US LAST SUMMER.  I HAVE BEEN ASSURED THAT
ALL THE MEN WILL BE ON THE JOB AGAIN THIS SUMMER. I UNDERSTAND THAT LAST
SUMMER TWO MEN PASSED UP THEIR VACATIONS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR
ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT WORKED PROPERLY.


                                         THANK YOU....
