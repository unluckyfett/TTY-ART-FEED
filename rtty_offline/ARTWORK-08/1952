                           ADAM RIBBED?

     ONE DAY ADAM NOTICED SOME STRANGE THINGS GOINGS-ON IN
THE GARDEN OF EDEN.  THE ANIMALS WOULD FREQUENTLY PAIR OFF
AND DISAPPEAR INTO THE BUSHES.  AFTER THRASHING AROUND A
LOT THEY EMERGED WITH A CONTENTED LOOK.
      "HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?"  ADAM ASKED GOD, AND GOD
EXPLAINED THAT HE WAS TO BUSY TO KEEP REPRODUCING ANIMALS
SO HE GAVE THEM THE POWER TO DO IT THEMSELVES.
     "HEY, THAT'S GREAT,"  ADAM SAID.  "BUT WHAT ABOUT ME?"
      SO GOD CREATED EVE AND ADAM ROMPED OFF INTO THE BUSHES
WITH HER.  HE WAS BACK IN LESS THAN A MINUTE. AND GOD SAID,
"YOU'RE A QUICK WORKER, ADAM."  BUT ADAM LOOKED TROUBLED.
"WHAT'S THE MATTER?"  GOD ASKED.
     "THERE'S ONE THING YOU DIDN'T TELL ME," ADAM SAID.
"WHAT'S A HEADACHE?"
