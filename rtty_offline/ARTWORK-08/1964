                     "THE FARMER AND THE BANKER"

AMONG OLDER NATIVES OF THE GREEN MOUNTAINS,THRIFT IS ABOUT AS DEEPSEATED
AS THE SPIRIT OF INDEPENDENCE...
A FAVORITE STORY CONCERNS A FARMER WHO WENT TO THE LITTLE BANK IN
CHELSEA TO BORROW SOME MONEY...
WHEN ASKED HOW MUCH HE WANTED, HE INDICATED HE'D LIKE "' BOUT A DOLLAR."
THE BANKER EXPRESSED SURPRISED AT THE SIZE OF THE REQUEST, BUT AGREED
TO THE DEAL, EXPLAINING THAT THE BANK WOULD HAVE TO HAVE SOME SECURITY...
THE FARMER SAID HE HAD A $ 1,000 GOVERMENT BOND; THE BANKER AGREED THAT
THIS WOULD BE ADEQUATE COVERAGE FOR SUCH A LOAN..AS FOR INTEREST, SIX
PERCENT WOULD BE THE CHARGE....
THE FARMER ALLOWED AS HOW HE WOULD LIKE TO PAY IN ADVANCE, SO HE PUT
DOWN THE BOND AND SIX CENTS, TOOK THE DOLLAR AND WENT ON HIS WAY...
A YEAR LATER, HE ASKED TO RENEW THE LOAN, AND PAID ANOTHER SIX CENTS
IN ADVANCE.
THE YEAR AFTER THAT, WHEN HE AGAIN REQUESTED RENEWAL, THE BANKER SAID
"IT'S PECULIAR THAT YOU, WITH THAT THOUSAND DOLLAR BOND, KEEP RENEWING
THIS ONE DOLLAR LOAN".
"WELL , IT'S DAMN PECULIAR," SAID THE FARMER, "THAT YOU BEEING A BANKER,
AIN'T FIGURD IT OUT. I WAS PAYING FIVE DOLLARS A YEAR FOR A LOCKBOX
TO KEEP THE BOND. NOW I'VE FOUND A WAY TO KEEP IT FOR SIX CENTS."......
