DEAR UNCLE SAM,

MY FRIEND BILL JONES OVER IN REYNOLDS COUNTY RECIEVED A CHECK FROM
THE GOVERNMENT FOR ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR NOT RAISING HOGS. SO, I
PLAN ON GOING INTO THE "NOT RAISING HOG" BUSINESS NEXT YEAR.
     WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS, IN YOUR OPINION, WHAT IS THE BEST KIND OF
FARM NOT TO RAISE HOGS ON, AND WHAT ARE THE BEST KIND OF HOGS NOT TO
RAISE? I WOULD PREFER NOT TO RAISE RAZORBACKS, BUT IF THAT IS NOT A GOOD
BREED NOT TO RAISE, I WILL GLADLY NOT RAISE BERKSHIRE OR DUROUX.
     THE HARDEST WORK IN THE BUSINESS IS GOING TO BE KEEPING INVENTORY
ON HOW MANY HOGS I'M NOT RAISING. MY FRIEND BILL IS VERY OPTOMISTIC
ABOUT THE FUTURE OF HIS BUSINESS. HE HAS BEEN RAISING HOGS FOR MORE
THAN THIRTY YEARS, AND THE MOST HE EVER MADE WAS $400.00 AND THAT WAS IN
1955. THAT WAS UNTIL THIS YEAR, AND THAT WAS WHEN HE GOT HIS CHECK FOR
$1000.00 FOR NOT RAISING HOGS.
     IF I CAN GET ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR NOT RAISING 50 HOGS, THEN
WILL I GET TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR NOT RAISING 100 HOGS? I PLAN TO
OPERATE ON A SMALL SCALE AT FIRST, HOLDING MY SELF DOWN TO ABOUT FOUR
THOUSAND HOGS, WHICH MEANS I WILL HAVE ABOUT $80,000.00 IN THE
BEGINNING. THEN I CAN AFFORD TO BUY THAT BOAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED.
     NOW ANOTHER THING, THESE HOGS I WILL NOT BE RAISING WILL NOT BE
EATING AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND BUSHELS OF CORN. I UNDERSTAND THAT
YOU ALSO PAY FARMERS FOR NOT RAISING CORN. SO WILL YOU PAY ME ANYTHING
FOR NOT RAISING ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND BUSHELS OF CORN FOR NOT FEEDING
THE HOGS I AM NOT GOING TO RAISE?
     I WANT TO GET STARTED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AS THIS SEEMS TO BE A
GOOD TIME OF THE YEAR FOR NOT RAISING HOGS. PLEASE LET ME HEAR FROM YOU
SOON.    SINCERELY,
