             I N
            SIXTH
            GRADE
        THE BELL WOULD
       NEVER COME  JUST
     IN THE NICK  OF TIME
     LIKE THE LONE RANGER
     TO SAVE ME FROM MISS
     SWAIN'S  LECTURE  ON
     SOME  DULL OLD  POET
     OR  SOME  SUCH THING
     OH I PRAYED FOR THAT
     MASKED  RINGING   TO
    RIDE UP ON SILVER WITH
   CLAPPERS  A-BLAZING.  NO
  SUCH LUCK....  INSTEAD   I
 WOULD HAVE TO DOODLE AWAY MY
BOREDOM....   TRYING  TO  SAVE
            MYSELF.


       HI HO SILVER BELL

   ADAPTED FOR RTTY BY JOHN,
