THE WAYSIDE CHAPEL.
-------------------

AN ENGLISH LADY, WHILE VISITING SWITZERLAND, WAS LOOKING FOR A ROOM.
SHE ASKED THE LOCAL SCHOOLMASTER IF HE COULD RECOMMEND ANY. HE TOOK HER
TO SEVERAL ROOMS. WHEN EVERYTHING WAS SETTLED ,  THE LADY RETURNED
HOME TO MAKE FULL PREPARATIONS FOR THE MOVE. WHEN SHE RETURNED HOME
THE THOUGHT SUDDENLY OCCURED TO HER THAT SHE HAD NOT SEEN A "WATER CLOSET"
( BATHROOM)  AROUND THE PLACE. SO SHE IMMEDIATELY WROTE A NOTE TO THE
SCHOOLMASTER ASKING HIM IF HE KNEW IF THERE WAS A "WC" AROUND. 
THE SCHOOLMASTER WAS NOT WELL VERSED IN ENGLISH SO HE ASKED THE PARISH
PRIEST IF HE COULD HELP IN THE MATTER. TOGETHER THEY TRIED TO DISCOVER
THE MEANING OF THE LETTERS "WC". THE ONLY SOLUTION THEY COULD ARRIVE AT
WAS WAYSIDE CHAPEL. THE SCHOOLMASTER , THEREFORE, WROTE THE FOLLOWING 
NOTE TO THE ENGLISH LADY WHO WANTED A "WC" IN CONNECTION WITH HER
ROOM.

DEAR MADAM:

       I TAKE GREAT PLEASURE IN INFORMING YOU THAT A "WC" IS SITUATED
NINE MILES FROM YOUR ROOM IN THE CENTER OF A BEAUTIFUL GROVE OF PINE
TREES SURROUNDED BY LEVEL GROUNDS.
       IT IS CAPABLE OF HOLDING 229 PEOPLE AND IT IS OPEN ON THURDAYS
AND SUNDAYS ONLY. AS THERE ARE A GREAT MANY PEOPLE EXPECTED DURING
THE SUMMER MONTHS I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU ALWAYS GO EARLY, ALTHOUGH
THERE IS USUALLY PLENTY OF STANDING ROOM. THIS IS AN UNFORTUNATE
SITUATION PARTICULARLY IF YOU ARE IN THE HABIT OF GOING REGULARLY. 
       YOU WILL , NO DOUBT, BE GLAD TO HEAR THAT A NUMBEROF PEOPLE
BRING THEIR OWN LUNCH AND MAKE A DAY OF IT WHILE OTHERS WHO CAN AFFORD
TO GO BY CAR ARRIVE JUST IN TIME. I WOULD ESPECIALLY ADVISE YOUR LADYSHIP
TO GO ON THURSDAY WHEN THERE IS AN ORGAN ACCOMPANIMENT. THE ACOUSTICS
OF THE "WC" ARE EXCELLENT AND EVEN THE MOST DELICATE OF SOUNDS CAN BE
HEARD BY EVERYONE.
       IT MAY INTEREST YOU TO KNOW THAT MY DAUGHTER WAS MARRIED IN THIS
"WC" AND IT WAS THERE THAT SHE MET HER HUSBAND. I CAN REMEMBER THE RUSH
FOR THE SEATS. THERE WERE TEN PEOPLE TO A SEAT USUALLY OCCUPIED BY ONE
AND IT WAS WONDERFUL TO SEE THE EXPRESSION ON THEIR FACES. 
       THE NEWEST ATTRACTION IS A BELL DONATED BY A WEALTHY RESIDENT OF
THE DISTRICT. IT RINGS 3 S EVERYTIME A PERSON ENTERS. 
       A BAZAAR IS TO BE HELD TO PROVIDE PLUSH SEATS FOR ALL SINCE THE
PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A LONG FELT NEED.
       MY WIFE IS RATHER DELICATE SO SHE CNNOT GO REGULARLY. IT IS
ALMOST A YEARSINCE SHE WENT LAST AND NATURALLY IT PAINS HER VERY MUCH
NOT TO BE ABLE TO GO MORE OFTEN.
       I SHALL BE DELIGHTED TO RESERVE THE BEST SEAT FOR YOU, IF YOU
WISH, AND ONE WHERE YOU CAN BE SEEN BY ALL.
       FOR THE CHILDREN THERE IS A SPECIAL PLACE SO THAT THEY WILL NOT
DISTURB THE ELDERS. 
       HOPING TO BE OF SERVICE TO YOU, I REMAIN 

THE SCHOOLMASTER.
